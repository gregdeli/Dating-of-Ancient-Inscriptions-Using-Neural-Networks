# Computational Intelligence Project

## Overview

This project applies computational intelligence techniques to analyze and process **ancient Greek inscriptions**. The primary objectives are **text classification**, **date prediction**, and exploring various machine learning models and techniques to gain insights from these historical texts. 

The project focuses on leveraging deep learning models, specifically built using **Keras**, to address the challenges of text classification and regression for date prediction.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of ancient Greek inscriptions, available at:

[Ancient Greek Inscriptions Dataset](https://eclass.upatras.gr/modules/document/file.php/CEID1060/iphi2802.csv)

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning and preparing** the ancient Greek text data.
- **Encoding and vectorization** of the text, converting it into a format suitable for machine learning models.

### 2. Text Classification
- Implementing **classification models** to categorize inscriptions.
- Using techniques like **TF-IDF** and **word embeddings** to process text data.

### 3. Date Prediction
- Developing models to **predict the date** of inscriptions based on their textual content.
- Exploring **regression models** for accurate date predictions.

### 4. Neural Network Implementation with Keras
- Designing and **training neural networks** using **Keras** for both classification and regression tasks.
- Experimenting with different network architectures and **hyperparameters** to optimize model performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluating the models using **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** for regression tasks.
- Implementing **early stopping** during training to prevent overfitting.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimizing **learning rates**, **momentum values**, and **dropout rates** to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.

## Tools and Technologies
